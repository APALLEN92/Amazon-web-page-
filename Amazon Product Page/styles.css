Alignment in Flex Container: You had align-items: center; in the .godcontainer class, which vertically centers the items within the flex container. To match the image, I changed this to align-items: flex-start; to align the image and text at the top of the container instead of the center.

Image Size: The width of your image was set to 75% in the original CSS, which didn't match the fixed width appearance of the image in the provided reference. I changed this to a fixed width of 200px to reflect the more static sizing seen in the image.

Title Styling: Your title had font-weight: lighter;, which made it appear less bold than in the image. I adjusted it to font-weight: bold; to make it match the boldness of the title in the image. */
